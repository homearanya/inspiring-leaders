They examine intellectual functioning (IQ) to assist parents and teachers understand a young person’s areas of intellectual strength or vulnerability, using both South African and international tests. These assessments serve as a screening for learning disabilities in children and adolescents. In such cases, I place specific focus on whether remedial assistance or other interventions are required to assist a learner to achieve according to their full potential.

####Assessments for Exam Concessions
They examine intellectual functioning (IQ) and scholastic ability to assist us to make an application for exam concessions to either the Independent Education Board or the Department of Education. This may result in recommendations for concessions such as additional time, spelling, anxiety and AD/HD, amongst others.
