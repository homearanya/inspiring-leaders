**Psychotherapy will provide a safe and accepting space to move towards a thriving life.**

####Therapy for Adults, Teenagers, Couples and Families

Psychotherapy comes in many different forms. Together we will decide on the right approach to help you move towards a life of thriving. We identify ways to move forward and use regular counselling or home-based exercises to remove the internal barriers to progress.

Psychotherapy provides a safe and accepting space to make this possible. Many men and women, children and adolescents, find that talking to a neutral, objective, confidential, non-judgemental psychotherapist is of enormous benefit to themselves and to their relationships.

If, for example, you wish to gain insight and understanding of the conscious and unconscious beliefs and feelings that may be holding you back from a fulfilling life, then I will help you to engage in gentle self-enquiry.On the other hand, if you do not really want to spend time exploring your past and how it affects you in the present, then we will give more attention to strengthening the skills neededto enable you to thrive no matter what you may have endured. Building your mindfulness abilities may be important.
