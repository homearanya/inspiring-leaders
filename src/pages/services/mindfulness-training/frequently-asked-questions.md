      Mindfulness has been described as a ‘state of mind’ that involves
      maintaining a moment-by-moment awareness of one’s thoughts, feelings,
      bodily sensations, and surrounding environment. When we practice
      mindfulness, our thoughts tune into what we're sensing in the present
      moment rather than being focused on the past or on the imagined future.
    question: What exactly is Mindfulness?
  - answer: >-
      Mindfulness practices are often taught secularly, but their roots involve
      an integration of Western psychology and a particular type of focused
      Buddhist meditation. The Massachusetts Medical School, in the USA, offered
      the first Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) course in 1979. This
      programme was designed and researched by Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn, who continues
      to be actively involved in this field.
    question: Where does mindfulness originate?
  - answer: >-
      Mindfulness can be thought of as a particular form of meditation. Broadly
      speaking, it is a meditative way of being in which one focuses one’s
      attention on what one is sensing and feeling in the moment, without
      interpretation or judgment.
    question: Is mindfulness only about meditating?
  - answer: >-
      Practising mindfulness means to give one’s focused attention to whatever
      it is best to focus one’s attention on in the moment. At times this will
      involve focusing intently on the conversation that one is having with
      another person. At other times, this will involve focusing closely on the
      email that one is typing. At yet other times, this will include focusing
      entirely on the delicious mouthful of coffee that one has taken... before
      moving one’s focus on to the next point of attention, which may be a
      particular feeling or emotion that is arising in the moment. As might be
      guessed, multi-tasking is the antithesis of mindfulness.
    question: What does practising mindfulness really mean?
  - answer: >-
      Yes, it does. By focusing our attention on the present moment, mindfulness
      effectively counteracts rumination and worrying. In other words,
      mindfulness can be an important tool for helping us to focus on the
      present moment rather than getting caught up in thoughts that are
      anxiety-provoking in nature. Research has shown that mindfulness helps to
      reduce anxiety (and depression) in most people who practice it on a daily
      basis.
    question: Does mindfulness work for anxiety?
  - answer: >-
      Yes. Numerous studies, such as one from the University of Oxford, have
      found that <strong>mindfulness</strong>-based cognitive therapy is just as
      effective as anti-depressants for preventing a relapse into
      <strong>depression</strong>. One important way in which this works is
      through building a greater awareness of one’s own body and mind, which
      enables one to identify signs of stress, and respond appropriately, long
      before depression might otherwise arise.
    question: Does mindfulness work for depression?
  - answer: >-
      Yes. Mindfulness helps in the effective management of chronic pain through
      building a greater awareness of one’s own body and mind. This enables one
      to identify the first miniscule sensations of physical discomfort as they
      arise together with any thoughts or feelings that may accompany the
      physical sensations... and then respond appropriately, long before the
      discomfort is experienced as intense pain.
    question: Does mindfulness help in the management of chronic pain?
  - answer: >-
      Mindfulness has a wide range of benefits. For example, it can induce the
      well-known relaxation response, which is very valuable in reducing the
      body's response to stress. Mindfulness also allows one to obtain maximum
      pleasure from every pleasurable moment that arises, such as enjoying that
      mouthful of delicious coffee... or enjoying the thought of being with
      one’s best friend, etc.
    question: What is the purpose of mindfulness practices?
  - answer: >-
      In 2011, a study conducted at Harvard University found that
      <strong>mindfulness</strong> meditation actually <strong>changes</strong>
      the structure of the <strong>brain</strong>: Eight weeks of
      <strong>Mindfulness</strong>-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) was found to
      <strong>increase cortical thickness</strong> in the hippocampus, which
      governs learning and memory, and in the prefrontal cortex, which regulates
      emotions and is involved in decision-making and problem-solving.
    question: How does mindfulness change the brain?
  - answer: >-
      You will learn how to incorporate mindfulness into your everyday living.
      You will be taught how to engage with mindfulness meditations that involve
      focusing on a single point of attention for an extended period of time,
      such as a 30-minute sitting meditation with a focus on the
      <strong>sensations</strong> of breathing, (such as the rise and fall of
      one’s chest). You will also learn how to bring ever-expanding
      <strong>moments of mindfulness</strong> into your day. You will also learn
      breathing methods and other practices to relax the body and mind and help
      reduce stress.
