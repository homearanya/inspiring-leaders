**Short training programmes are offered to leaders and those moving into leadership positions, designed to optimise performance, strengthen leadership skills and increase well-being.**

####Training Programme for Inspirational Leadership
For organizations and individuals that are looking for deep engagement and long-term impact, two short courses are offered, one of which is SAQA-Accredited (at NQF level 5), focusing on building the emotional intelligence skills of individuals who are either about to step into managerial positions or who are already occupying leadership positions within an organisation.

These training programmes are offered as a unique two- or three-day course that was initially developed and refined at Google within the Search Inside Yourself Leadership Institute (SIYLI). It focuses on five key domains of emotional intelligence: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills – with mindfulness practice, science, and leadership applications fully integrated at all levels.

This programme helps organisations address some of their most difficult challenges:

- Building resilience in times of rapid change
- Helping leaders solve not just technical but adaptive problems, which have no clear answers
- Supporting people to thrive in a fast-paced, connected world without boundaries
- Creating an inspired workplace that supports true human development.

The programme is highly interactive and trains individuals to optimise performance, strengthen leadership skills and increase well-being. Each session is approximately one-third content and two-thirds skill training. Skills training includes individual, dyadic and group exercise consisting of attention training, active listening with verbal feedback, writing exercise and emotion regulation.

####Programme Details
This training programme is highly interactive and involves six sessions of 2 hours each. It integrates the theory and practices of mindfulness and the supporting science, and provides the tools and skills to improve stress management skills, workplace effectiveness, and happiness.

This is a highly interactive programme that integrates the theory and practices of mindfulness, emotional intelligence, and the supporting science. It provides the tools and skills to improve workplace effectiveness, leadership, and happiness.

The programme works in three steps:

1. **Attetion Training:** Attention is the basis of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities. Train attention to ensure clarity of mind. This quality of mind – both calm and alert – forms the foundation for emotional intelligence.
2. **Self-Knowledge and Self-Mastery:** Use trained attention to understand cognitive and emotional processes. This knowledge provides the individual with the ability to regulate and master emotions.
3. **Create Useful Habits and Leadership Skills:** Develop the habits of leading with compassion and communicating with insight. These habits can be learned and will create trust that leads to highly productive collaborations.

**Programme participants will:**

- Learn several mental training practices, including self-awareness, attention training and an introduction to emotional intelligence, that are useful in enhancing work place skills.
- Learn practices designed to enhance concentration and creativity, improve self-awareness and emotional process, enhance self-confidence and optimism.
- Learn practices for developing alignment, clarifying vision and building resilience, as well as practices for leading with compassion and influencing with insight.

####Who Should Attend?
Leaders in organisations everywhere. Each organisation needs emotionally intelligent leaders. All organisations can benefit from a more mindful and self-aware workforce. This programme is especially for those who want to support their organisation’s ability to build an inspiring, high-performance workplace.

####Course Delivery
The first part of this course consists of **face-to-face training**. The second part of this course consists of a **4-week post-programme follow-up**:

- Sustaining and integrating the practices and benefits of the programme
- Partnered conversations with fellow participants from your programme

**Note:** When requested by an organisation for a specific group of employees, it is possible to structure this course in a way that suits the organisation. For example, the two days of face-to-face training can be provided as four half day sessions of 3½ - 4 hours each.
