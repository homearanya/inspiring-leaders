**Short seminars are offered to those in leadership positions, and are designed to strengthen leadership skills and increase well-being.**

**Seminars** are primarily designed to strengthen Emotional Intelligence (EQ) in the workplace, improve stress management, and boost interpersonal communication amongst other key leadership skills and competencies.

An organisation might employ me to present information and/or provide advice on a given topic to the management team which will enable them to become more effective leaders and experience greater levels of happiness and work engagement. The focus of a seminar depends on the needs of the organisation, and may include such topics as:

1. How to cultivate happy and engaged employees
2. How to implement and support mindfulness in the workplace
3. How to support employees during periods of organisational change
4. How to use rewards and recognition to promote high levels of work engagement
5. How to support employees in achieving a positive work-life balance
6. How to develop a relevant health and wellness strategy for one’s employees
