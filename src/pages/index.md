          I am an educator at heart and feel as passionate about individual
          therapy as I do about interacting with groups. I get great joy from
          sharing my knowledge and experience with community organisations,
          corporates and schools in a way that is both accessible and inspiring.

          I have come to understand that optimal brain functioning is the

          life free of physical complaints.
