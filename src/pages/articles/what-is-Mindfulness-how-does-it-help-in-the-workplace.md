Many of us have heard about it. Richard Branson swears by it. And it has become part of company culture in corporate entities such as Google, Nike, Sony, Ford and Apple. “It” is mindfulness. Often described as the mental equivalent of going to the gym, mindfulness provides relief for stressed professionals, requiring them to slow down, stop, breathe, and find a moment to be in the present.

##What exactly is mindfulness?

Mindfulness is often referred to as meditation, but it is perhaps more useful to view it as: _a “state of mind” that allows one to focus on whatever needs to be the focus of attention in the present moment_. So, for example, mindfulness allows one to focus fully upon a work task even though one may be experiencing significant levels of stress relating to difficulties in the workplace, the home environment, or in one’s life in general. In such a situation, if an anxiety-provoking thought arises in one’s mind, mindfulness allows one to notice the thought as it arises and **decide** whether it needs one’s attention **before** one gets caught up in the difficult feelings and thoughts.

So, rather than trying to stop one’s mind from wandering, which neuroscience suggests it does a lot of the time, a mindful state of mind allows one to notice a thought, and any accompanying emotion, as it arises and decide there and then whether it requires one’s attention or not. If the thought does not require one’s attention, we are able to quickly refocus and place our full attention back onto the task at hand and, in this way, raise our level of effectiveness while reducing our stress levels considerably.

To put it another way, mindfulness requires us to intentionally focus on the present moment, and to accept and pay non-judgmental attention to the sensations, thoughts, and emotions that arise. This deep engagement with the here-and-now is combined with an attitude of acceptance and openness, allowing thoughts and emotions to come and go without judgement or evaluation. The idea is to not intentionally add anything to the present moment experience, but to be aware of what is going on, without losing yourself in anything that arises. (Consider the value of that sort of utterly calm mental and emotional discipline for stressful interactions with work colleagues (and others, including family members, etc.)

##What are the benefits of mindfulness in the workplace?

But, you may ask, does Mindfulness really produce benefits within the workplace? Is the return worth the time investment? Research suggests that the answer is a definite “YES”. This is because engaging with mindfulness practices on a regular basis throughout one’s day slowly but surely results in significant changes occurring in the structure of one’s brain which, in turn, result in the following significant changes in one’s functioning:

- The prefrontal cortex, which is involved in decision-making, problem-solving, emotional regulation and focused attention, works better. This is because the connections between nerve cells increase and the brain tissue thickens and, as a result, becomes more efficient and effective.

- Being mindful or meditating briefly reduces levels of cortisol, the hormone responsible for inducing stress, and can thicken grey matter in the brain and improve the ability to process information. It can also trigger the release of serotonin and endorphins, two hormones that help with focus and motivation.

- Mindfulness helps one to focus on the present situation without becoming caught up in difficult emotions and thoughts. As such, mindfulness is a mental hygiene technique that helps to minimise the negative impact of constant interruptions and can sharpen skills like attention, memory, and emotional intelligence. Research has shown that our minds have a tendency to wander at least 50% of the time. But studies show that mindfulness training can help curb our tendency for distraction, strengthen our ability to stay focused and even boost memory.

- Mindfulness can enhance creativity, because we come up with our greatest insights and biggest breakthroughs when we are in a more meditative and relaxed state of mind. That is when we have “eureka” moments, probably because the deep engagement, openness and acceptance involved in mindfulness encourages divergent thinking (i.e. coming up with the greatest number of possible solutions to a problem), a key component of creativity.

- Mindfulness helps boost one’s mood and increases one’s sense of connection to others. In other words, mindfulness is a powerful ally in situations of stress which would otherwise narrow your perspective, reduce empathy, and impact cognitive performance negatively. Practising mindfulness can improve your relationships by (at the least) removing the emotional charge from unavoidable stressful situations and possibly by eventually leading you to be a kinder and more compassionate person.

##How does one cultivate mindfulness in the workplace?

In order to cultivate mindfulness, i.e. a mindful state of mind, one can simply engage in regular moments of mindfulness throughout one’s day, such as through paying close attention to what is happening in the present moment either in the external environment and/or within one’s inner world of thoughts, feelings and physical/bodily sensations. It can be as simple as sitting quietly for a few minutes and paying attention to the physical sensations accompanying the most basic life affirming act – breathing – and actively experiencing the sensations of air entering and leaving your nose and/or causing the chest and belly to expand and subside.

Mindfulness can also be practised more formally – the mental equivalent of regular, scheduled exercise – during a sustained period of focused attention as part of a predetermined routine.

To achieve the sort of clear and focused thinking that is possible, along with enhanced mental flexibility, requires that one engages with mindfulness practices or exercises on a regular basis throughout one’s day. The problem for many people, however, is that they’re already operating at their maximum level, and find themselves having to shift from one task or activity to the next with no time for adequate consideration and reflection. Investing in something like mindfulness may therefore seem to be just another thing to add to everyone’s to-do list!

International research shows that mindfulness is something anyone can, with practise, do oneself and gain tremendous benefit from. A little bit of training or outside input, however, will certainly ease the process of making mindfulness part of one’s daily work routine. And, as indicated at the start of this article, this is something that numerous organisations have recognised and acted upon. Google is one such organisation which, in 2007, employed the services of a range of experts in the fields of mindfulness and Emotional Intelligence (EI), including Daniel Goleman, to develop an in-house training programme for their staff. In 2012 Google established the Search Inside Yourself Leadership Institute (SIYLI), an organisation that now offers this programme to individuals and organisations from other parts of the world. And I (Alistair) was fortunate enough to attend their two-day intensive programme in October 2017, when it was offered in South Africa to business leaders for the first time. The outcome of this was that I was given permission to use the SIYLI materials and course framework to develop a programme that is relevant to the South African business world, and am now offering this programme to our local business community.

**_What really excites me is the fact that Mindfulness is a very effective way of cultivating Emotional Intelligence (EI) skills and abilities, including the foundational skill/s of self-awareness upon which the critical skills of self-management, social awareness and relationship management can then be built._**
