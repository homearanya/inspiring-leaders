Every organisation has a culture. It stems from the company’s values and attitudes and is reinforced by your managers and most senior employees in everything that they do. The culture of an organisation affects everything in the organisation, and it lets your employees know what is expected and appropriate. It is most clearly evident in how the managers and senior employees engage and interact with one another and with other employees. Whatever the culture, it has a major impact on both the emotional wellbeing and the productivity of your employees.

It is therefore surprising that explicit attention, time and effort, is often not given to creating a culture where employees **feel valued**. This is very unfortunate as the research indicates that organisations will generally see improvements in productivity, innovation, financial performance, and reductions in absence and staff turnover when employees feel valued. An employee that feels valued is more motivated to perform to a high standard for an employer.

By contrast, at organisations with a culture where employees feel ignored and undervalued, they are more likely to be demotivated, dissatisfied and looking for somewhere new to work.

Below, I share some ways in which an employer can help employees develop a strong sense of being valued and, as a consequence, cultivate a positive culture and a happy and productive workforce:

## 1. Provide employees with opportunities to feel heard

A relatively simple but effective way to make your employees feel valued is to listen to them. This requires that you ask them for their opinions, take on board their suggestions and solicit their advice where appropriate. For this to be seen as genuine, you have to be prepared to act on their suggestions as well. Once employees recognise that their opinions matter, and start to see relevant change, they will feel more valued.

Actively encouraging employees to raise complaints alongside possible solutions can create a small yet effective change in cultural thinking. This will increase the wellbeing of your employees as their concerns will be validated and you can work together to devise solutions that benefit both employer and employee.

## 2. Provide employees with wellness support

Building a culture where your employees are both provided with wellness benefits and are encouraged to make their health a priority can result in individuals feeling valued and, as a consequence, improve their wellbeing and productivity.

You can help improve the health of your employees by offering a range of health and wellbeing services that suit you and your employees. This can leave your employees feeling more in control of their health and more valued.

Another way to promote health is to encourage regular exercise. There are a number of ways to do this, including offering on-site access to gym equipment, yoga classes or discounts for local gym memberships. Discounted healthy food can be offered at lunchtime, to make healthy eating easier, and will go a long way to improving employee wellbeing.

Mental health is often neglected in favour of physical health, yet it is often more important. You can demonstrate this understanding by providing your employee with wellness support, including access to psychological help.

Currently few South Africans will enter treatment for depression, anxiety and other psychological concerns and even fewer will actually complete treatment plans put in place. Additional support and education from employers will help remove the stigma attached to mental wellbeing and improve the success of treatment.

## 3. Provide a work environment that will support physical health

International research suggests that many employees who suffer from a musculoskeletal disorder think it was either caused or worsened by work. And in the UK, as an example, literally millions of working days are lost because of back issues. Bad backs are frustratingly common but you can help your office-based employees avoid lower back pain by paying attention to the ergonomics of their office.

Standing desks, appropriate lighting and temperatures, and even ergonomic items such as lumbar supports and foot supports can all improve the physical wellbeing of your employees, as well as showing the employee the value their physical health. Brief and regular “training” for those employees engaging in physical labour can help to prevent back injuries, pain, and absenteeism.

## 4. Assist employees to cultivate a better work/ life balance

Employees who feel they achieve a good work/life balance are happier at work. And research suggests that happier employees are generally more efficient, productive and motivated. While ensuring such a balance isn’t the sole responsibility of employers, you can do a lot to help by establishing supportive policies and realistic expectations such as:

– Encouraging employees to take their lunch-break, rather than eating while working;
– Flexible working options (e.g. remote working, job sharing, etc.);
– Paid time off policies; and
– Encouraging employees to leave on time regularly.

Of course what equals a good work/ life balance for one employee is not necessarily right for another. Employees are individual and your approach must be too.

**_Just a few changes can shift your business culture and make it one that really cares about the health and wellbeing of your workforce and genuinely values each and every employee._**
