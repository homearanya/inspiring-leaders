Many forward-thinking employers have begun to recognise **happiness at work** as a key piece of the productivity puzzle; it is a factor that cannot be ignored, with most research concluding that happy employees are more engaged and, therefore, more productive. In fact, there seems to be a direct correlation between a thriving workforce and better performance when employees are happy.

Sadly, however, it appears that many employees feel fed up, burned out and unhappy at work. Have they just got to work a little harder at being happy at work under the everyday pressures or does the employer need to take on some responsibility for this as well?

Well, international research points to the critical importance of **healthy workplace relationships**! In this regard, it seems that mutual relationships, where both parties feel at ease and comfortable, are the basis for happiness. When an employee starts to feel that they can be open and honest and will not be judged by their peers or by the senior employees’ happiness grows.

####How does happiness impact on employee engagement?

In the past, most people went to work primarily in order to earn a living. This may still be so for the majority of individuals whose daily work involves manual labour, but it has changed dramatically for most others. For these employees, especially the millennials, they are looking for more; to be engaged and happy, to feel a sense of fulfilment; and to feel that they are part of the greater whole. More so now than ever before, companies need to recognise just how important the happiness of their employees is, and how it will positively affect the bottom line. Listening carefully and responding in encouraging ways is an effective first step to take towards cultivating and deepening workplace relationships, which will, in turn, improve happiness levels and engage employees positively.

Relationships need to be strengthened across departments as well as across all levels, be it between a manager and an intern, the Finance team with the Marketing team, the Call Centre with Product team. Stronger connections help employees develop a deeper understanding of what other teams do, bolsters their functions and enables them to be more productive.

Simply put, happy employees are more productive than unhappy employees. Happy employees make an organisation a desirable place to work, and happiness amongst teams are a great retention tool, which yields greater results than constantly hiring and training new staff members.

####How does one promote employee happiness?

The question of what supports or promotes employee happiness proves to be very interesting.

International research suggests that some of the happiest workers are employed within the marketing, communications and advertising industries. However, the sector in which an individual is employed is only one important factor affecting their happiness.

Research suggests that an employee’s base pay often plays a very important role in an individual’s happiness. However, other crucial factors have come to light, including good co-worker relationships and the nature of the work.

As indicated, a good relationship with management and the sense of being valued by managers and other senior employees has also been found to be important, alongside flexible working, the office environment, annual leave and workload. Interestingly, end-of-year financial bonuses are often one of the lowest rated factors for improving happiness.

Thus, providing regular opportunities for the development of supportive and encouraging relationship can motivate teams to be more industrious. In this regard, healthier relationships can be cultivated through regular feedback sessions, one-to-one meetings and reviews, team events, social outings and even targeted training that focuses on building the self-awareness and self-management skills and abilities of employees.

In general, satisfying relationships not only make people happy, but they have a long-term influence on one’s health and general wellbeing. On the other hand, relationships that regularly involve feelings of discomfort have the opposite effect which can be damaging and can alienate team members.

Ultimately, employee happiness cannot be distilled down to one specific cause. There are many variables that contribute to an individual’s happiness, which makes a one-size-fits-all solution impossible. If increased workplace happiness is the goal, employers must focus on the overall employee experience. Doing this will have a positive knock-on effect with regard to retention, engagement and productivity.
