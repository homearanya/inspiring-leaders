I am a psychologist and training facilitator. In my work with organisations I draw on the latest research findings, specifically those which deal with supporting optimal levels of work engagement, cultivating a mindful approach to work, and building emotional intelligence.

> “All of my roles involve helping individuals and groups to implement lasting, positive change.”

I have an extensive background and personal commitment to embodying mindfulness and emotional intelligence skills. I have spent years cultivating the presence and resilience to teach these skills, especially within the context of leadership development, while standing firmly in science.

I am an educator at heart, and obtain great joy from interacting with groups, sharing my knowledge and experience with organisations, corporates and schools in a way that is both accessible and inspiring.

> I look forward to the chance to help you and your organisation reach ever-greater heights in the coming year.
