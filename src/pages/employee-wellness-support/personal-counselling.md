**Individual counselling services are offered for individuals who require guidance and/or emotional support during difficult times.**

During difficult times, an individual may want to talk things over with someone who is unbiased or receive professional counselling and guidance to help them deal with matters which affect their overall health and wellness and performance at work.

I offer organisations a confidential, personal support and information service. This includes access to life management advice through face-to-face and telephone counselling that focuses on the following matters amongst others:

- **Stress & burnout**: work-related, personal
- **Relationships**: spouse, family, friends, work colleagues
- **Substance abuse**: alcohol, drugs, comfort eating
- **Family matters**: divorce, child care, care for elderly parents
- **Health issues**: exercise and movement, healthy eating, HIV and AIDS
- **Work**: career matters, dealing with the boss, managing others
- **Bereavement**: grief, loss
- **Mental health**: Clinical depression, anxiety disorders, trauma
