topics:
  - topic: 1.	How to manage stress more effectively
    content:
      paragraphs:
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>This session gives attention to Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). The key focus is on how it is possible to engage with stress, anxiety and other negative feelings in a counter-intuitive, but highly effective manner. Attention is given to learning how to hold difficult emotions and thoughts in one’s awareness without feeling overwhelmed by them, getting caught up in them, and/or avoiding them.</p>
  - topic: 2.	How to manage oneself for constructive workplace relationships
    content:
      paragraphs:
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>This session provides participants with an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of themselves and of their emotional habits, including those that can lead to unresolved conflict, feelings of resentment, and destructive interactions in the workplace.</p>
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>Participants are provided with the knowledge that will help them take the first steps towards ensuring that workplace relationship challenges do not become insurmountable problems.</p>
  - topic: 3.	How to deal with difficult interpersonal situations
    content:
      paragraphs:
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>This session gives attention to those times when a colleague says or does something that causes one to feel hurt, angered and/or in some way upset. Confronting the ‘guilty’ party in order to ensure that they do not engage in the same action/s again is critical. Participants learn how important it is, within such an interaction, to help the other express his/her feelings while also expressing one’s own.</p>
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>Participants are shown how, in any confrontation situation, if one is able to help the other person feel at least cared for, listened to, and understood, then one is effectively applying emotional intelligence to the resolution process. Attention is given to three emotionally intelligent communication “techniques” that help immensely during confrontation.</p>
  - topic: 4.	How to achieve a healthy Work-Life balance
    content:
      paragraphs:
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>This session helps employees to take their first steps towards creating enough time for both work and the many other facets of their lives and, in so doing, build a positive work-life balance.</p>
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>There is no doubt that when an individual is given the space and time to live a whole and rounded life their sense of wellbeing increases, and they feel happier. And as much recent research highlights, a happier workforce is good for business. On the other hand, muddling through with a poor work-life balance is no fun; it makes employees more disengaged with life in general, envious of their friends’ lifestyles and feeling alienated by modern life. It’s bad news for their mental health too.</p>
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>Poor mental well-being directly affects how employees behave at work –research on work related stress suggests that stress accounts for nearly half of all working days lost because of ill health. Research on work-life balance shows how a poor balance can lead to absence, low productivity and stress. But when balance is achieved, benefits can include better levels of efficiency and productivity, lower levels of absence, sickness and stress, and a motivated workforce.</p>
  - topic: 5.	How to build and sustain one’s motivation
    content:
      paragraphs:
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>This session gives attention to what individuals can do in order to “keep motivated” in engaging with work tasks and activities, especially when one’s work has become boring or unpleasant (and/or one’s supervisor is unable to inspire one to sustain a high level of work performance and productivity).</p>
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>Participants are given an opportunity to identify the intrinsically rewarding elements of their job. Specifically, participants are encouraged to reflect upon the positive emotions that may help to build and sustain motivation levels even when an activity causes some distress. Examples are given to show how one can use a range of different emotions to motivate oneself to sustain engagement with unpleasant tasks and activities.</p>
  - topic: 6.	How to boost brain health through the food we eat
    content:
      paragraphs:
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>This session draws on recent research that clearly shows that the food we eat, and don’t eat, has a huge impact on brain health and, therefore, on our mental functioning.</p>
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>Most of us eat what is termed “the modern diet”, involving the daily consumption of refined carbohydrates, added sugar and processed foods. This diet is often associated with cognitive deficits and a worsening of mental health status, including increased levels of anxiety. Conversely, research has found a lower risk for mental health problems, e.g. depression, when we eat better-quality diets.</p>
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>Attention is given to the foods that should be limited in order to see improvements in one’s mental health. Participants are also provided with clear guidelines with regard to the foods that should be eaten regularly in order to ensure a positive impact on the brain and, especially, on the brain proteins that are extremely important in depression, protecting the brain against the effects of stress and promoting the growth of new brain cells.</p>
  - topic: 7.	How to boost brain health through movement, meditation & (more) sleep
    content:
      paragraphs:
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>This session gives attention to the research that shows that adequate sleep, regular cardio-vascular exercise and daily meditative practice (such as mindfulness practice) have a very positive impact on brain functioning and mental health. Mindfulness-based interventions, in particular, have been shown to be superior to therapy focused on exercise and healthy eating in patients with treatment-resistant depression.</p>
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>Attention is given to the types of exercise that can be engaged with in order to see improvements in one’s mental health. Participants are also provided with clear guidelines with regard to ensuring that one obtains between 7 and 9 hours of unbroken sleep (every night).</p>
  - topic: 8.	How to manage change within the workplace
    content:
      paragraphs:
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>This session focuses attention on the steps that employees can take towards adjusting effectively to change/s in the workplace. Change can be extremely hard for most people. It brings up much fear, sabotage and resistance. This leads to frustration, lack of self trust, despair and fear. And when one is in a state of fear, it is almost impossible to learn new behaviours. Fear prevents the brain from laying down new tracks of information.<p>
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>The good news, however, is that it is quite possible to transcend one’s biological and physiological ‘destiny’. Scientific research shows that it is quite possible to rewire one’s brain.</p>
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>There is, however, no one best way to adjust to change. People find success in a variety of different approaches. The key is to find something that is realistic and sustainable in the long run, and mindfulness may be a very effective tool to achieving this.</p>
  - topic: 9. How to manage the transition to retirement
    content:
      paragraphs:
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>This session is designed for individuals who are about to enter retirement. Many people are taken by surprise at the high levels of uncertainty, anxiety and unhappiness they experience during this period of dramatic change. They are very keen to explore the various options that exist with regard to their future as a retired person. Participants are given an opportunity to gain knowledge of the process of change, learn about approaches to coping with one’s new life situation, and interact with others who share similar concerns and experiences.</p>
  - topic: 10. Understanding and managing clinical depression
    content:
      paragraphs:
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>This session focuses on building participants’ understanding of Clinical Depression, a poorly understood yet incredibly common mental health problem, believed to afflict up to 25% of the population. Attention is given to all of the following sub-topics:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Symptoms</li>
            <li>Causes</li>
            <li>Treatment and Prevention</li>
            <li>Supporting someone who is Clinically Depressed.</li>
            </ul>
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>Particular attention is given to the critical importance of regular stress reduction practices, a healthy diet, daily movement and exercise, ensuring excellent sleep hygiene, and the maintenance of a strong network of social support.</p>

**A broad range of inspiring talks and workshops are offered in order to enable the achievement of optimal health and wellbeing and superior job performance.**

For most of us balancing the demands of work and family life is not always easy. Often all an employee needs is **information** and a few new **skills**, but they don’t know where to find this.

I offer organisations input on a wide range of topics that are crucial to the sustained wellness and optimal job performance of employees. Depending on the needs of your employees, topics are covered through either short (1 hr) presentations or through longer (2.5 hr) workshops (which provide more time for group exercises, personal reflection and discussion). The following topics are currently offered:
