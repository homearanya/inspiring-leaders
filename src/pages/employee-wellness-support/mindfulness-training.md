  - topic: 1.	What exactly is Mindfulness?
    content:
      paragraphs:
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>Mindfulness has been described as a <strong><em>‘state of mind’</em></strong> that involves maintaining a moment-by-moment awareness of one’s thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and surrounding environment. When we practice mindfulness, we tune more fully into what we're engaging with and/or sensing in the present moment rather than being focused on the past or on the imagined future.</p>
  - topic: 2.	Where does mindfulness originate?
    content:
      paragraphs:
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>Mindfulness practices are often taught secularly, but their roots involve an integration of Western psychology and a particular type of focused Buddhist meditation. The Massachusetts Medical School and Hospital offered the first Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) course in 1979. This was initially designed and researched by Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn.</p>
  - topic: 3.	Is mindfulness only about meditating?
    content:
      paragraphs:
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>Mindfulness can be thought of as a particular form of meditation. Broadly speaking, it is a meditative way of being in which one focuses one’s attention on what one is sensing and feeling in the moment, without interpretation or judgment.</p>
  - topic: 4.	What does practicing mindfulness really mean?
    content:
      paragraphs:
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>Practicing mindfulness means to give one’s focused attention to whatever it would be best to focus one’s attention on in the moment. At times this will involve focusing entirely on the conversation that one is having with another person. At other times, this will involve focusing entirely on the email that one is typing. At yet other times, this will include focusing entirely on the delicious mouthful of coffee that one has taken... before moving one’s focus on to the next point of attention, which may be a particular feeling or emotion that is arising in the moment.</p>
  - topic: 5.	Does mindfulness work for anxiety?
    content:
      paragraphs:
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>Yes it does. By focusing our attention on the present moment, mindfulness effectively counteracts rumination and worrying. In other words, mindfulness can be an important tool for helping us to focus on the present moment rather than getting caught up in thoughts that are stress-provoking in nature. Research has shown that mindfulness helps to reduce stress, including the emotions of anxiety and frustration, in most people who practice it on a daily basis.</p>
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>One important way in which this works is through building a greater awareness of one’s own body and mind, which enables one to identify signs of stress, and respond appropriately, long before stress might otherwise begin to impact one negatively.</p>
  - topic: 6.	What is the purpose of mindfulness practices?
    content:
      paragraphs:
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>Mindfulness has a wide range of benefits. For example, it can induce the well-known relaxation response, which is very valuable in reducing the body's response to stress. Mindfulness also allows one to obtain maximum pleasure from every pleasurable moment that arises, such as enjoying that mouthful of delicious coffee... or enjoying the thought of the next round of golf, etc.</p>
  - topic: 7.	How does mindfulness change the brain?
    content:
      paragraphs:
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>In 2011, a study conducted at Harvard University, found that <strong>mindfulness</strong> meditation actually <strong>changes</strong> the structure of the <strong>brain</strong>: Eight weeks of <strong>Mindfulness</strong>-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) was found to <strong>increase cortical thickness</strong> in the hippocampus, which governs learning and memory, and in the prefrontal cortex, which regulates emotions and is involved in decision-making and problem-solving.</p>
  - topic: 8.	What will I learn on a mindfulness course?
    content:
      paragraphs:
        - paragraph: >-
            <p>You will learn how to incorporate mindfulness into your work day as well as into everyday living. You will be taught how to engage with mindfulness meditations that involve focusing on a single point of attention for an extended period of time, such as a 30 minute sitting meditation with a focus on the <strong>sensations</strong> of breathing, (such as the rise and fall of one’s chest). You will also learn how to bring ever-expanding <strong>moments of mindfulness</strong> into your day. You will also learn breathing methods and other practices to relax the body and mind and help reduce stress</p>

####Mindfulness Training Programme: Cultivating Calm in a Stressful World
Mindfulness has a variety of research-backed impacts, including a reduction in ‘toxic’ stress, and an improvement in job satisfaction, emotional regulation, focus, and executive functioning.

For organizations and individuals that are looking for deep engagement and long-term impact, this **six-week** mindfulness training programme focuses on building the mindfulness skills of the people within an organisation. It is based on the very popular 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) course that is offered in countries all around the globe.

This programme helps individuals address many of the difficult challenges associated with living and working in a fast-paced, connected world without boundaries.

####Programme Details
This training programme is highly interactive and involves six sessions of 2 hours each. It integrates the theory and practices of mindfulness and the supporting science, and provides the tools and skills to improve stress management skills, workplace effectiveness, and happiness.

**A key objective of this course** is to introduce participants to a range of mindfulness meditations and help each individual to cultivate a personal mindfulness practice. If a participant is interested in integrating mindfulness with their daily routine, this course is an important step in the process. Both beginners and those with some experience will find this course extremely worthwhile.

**During this six-week course, participants will learn:**

- The basics of mindfulness meditation
- How to work with ‘negative’ patterns of thinking (and feeling)
- Techniques for meeting and navigating intense emotions
- Practices that cultivate positive states of mind like gratitude, kindness, joy & compassion
- The role mindfulness plays in communication and interaction
- Support for developing a daily practice

####Who Should Attend?
Employees at all levels. All organisations can benefit from a more mindful and self-aware workforce. This programme is especially for those individuals who want to support their organisation’s ability to build an inspiring, high-performance workplace.

####Course Delivery
This course consists of face-to-face training.

**Note:** I offer organisations a 1-hour introductory presentation to generate interest and enthusiasm for the training programme.
Because practicing mindfulness with colleagues can help to enrich a participant’s course experience, I encourage groups of between 8 and 14 individuals.
