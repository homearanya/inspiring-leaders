**Training in Mindfulness helps employees manage stress more effectively, strengthen their focus, and improve performance and job satisfaction.**

####Mindfulness Training Programme: Cultivating Calm in a Stressful World
Mindfulness has a variety of research-backed impacts, including a reduction in ‘toxic’ stress, and an improvement in job satisfaction, emotional regulation, focus, and executive functioning.

For organizations and individuals that are looking for deep engagement and long-term impact, this **six-week** mindfulness training programme focuses on building the mindfulness skills of the people within an organisation. It is based on the very popular 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) course that is offered in countries all around the globe.

This programme helps individuals address many of the difficult challenges associated with living and working in a fast-paced, connected world without boundaries.

####Programme Details
This training programme is highly interactive and involves six sessions of 2 hours each. It integrates the theory and practices of mindfulness and the supporting science, and provides the tools and skills to improve stress management skills, workplace effectiveness, and happiness.

**A key objective of this course** is to introduce participants to a range of mindfulness meditations and help each individual to cultivate a personal mindfulness practice. If a participant is interested in integrating mindfulness with their daily routine, this course is an important step in the process. Both beginners and those with some experience will find this course extremely worthwhile.

**During this six-week course, participants will learn:**

- The basics of mindfulness meditation
- How to work with ‘negative’ patterns of thinking (and feeling)
- Techniques for meeting and navigating intense emotions
- Practices that cultivate positive states of mind like gratitude, kindness, joy & compassion
- The role mindfulness plays in communication and interaction
- Support for developing a daily practice

####Who Should Attend?
Employees at all levels. All organisations can benefit from a more mindful and self-aware workforce. This programme is especially for those individuals who want to support their organisation’s ability to build an inspiring, high-performance workplace.

####Course Delivery
This course consists of face-to-face training.

**Note:** I offer organisations a 1-hour introductory presentation to generate interest and enthusiasm for the training programme.
Because practicing mindfulness with colleagues can help to enrich a participant’s course experience, I encourage groups of between 8 and 14 individuals.
